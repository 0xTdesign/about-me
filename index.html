        <h2>My Bio</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Tim, I'm 34 years old, I'm from the UK but I've lived in Dubai for almost 30 years.
          I love to spearfish, go offroading in the desert and travel. I have 4 cats and so I'm officially classified as a 'crazy cat person'!
          I started learning Crypto in early 2020 and have continued to develop my interests and knowledge in this area, I am now learning to become a Software Developer.
          I am passionate about this industry and I love what I have learnt so far! I am excited to see where this next step takes me. 
          Have a nosey around my website, and feel free to contact me for any further information. Peace.
        </p>
